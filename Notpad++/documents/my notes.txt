Ensure Auditing is Enabled: Make sure that auditing is properly configured and enabled for the actions you want to track.
Regular Monitoring: Regularly monitor and review audit logs to ensure any suspicious or unauthorized activities are promptly addressed.

-- To see session logins
SELECT
    USERNAME,
    TIMESTAMP,
    ACTION_NAME,
    SESSION_ID,

how to add 2dbwriter?
##ALTER SYSTEM SET DB_WRITER_PROCESSES=2 SCOPE=BOTH;


What Happens if You BG Kill These Processes?( V&process or v$bgprocess)

PMON (Process Monitor):
Role: PMON cleans up after failed processes, releases resources, and performs process recovery.
Impact if Killed: If PMON is killed, Oracle will try to restart it. If PMON cannot be restarted, the instance will crash. You might see an ORA-00600 error.

SMON (System Monitor):
Role: SMON performs crash recovery, cleans up temporary segments, and coalesces free space.
Impact if Killed: If SMON is killed, Oracle will attempt to restart it. If unsuccessful, the instance will crash. 
This can lead to issues with space management and crash recovery.

LGWR (Log Writer): oracle create automatically
Role: LGWR is responsible for writing redo log buffer entries to the online redo log files.
Impact if Killed: If LGWR is killed, the instance will immediately crash. This is because Oracle relies on LGWR to ensure data integrity through the redo logs.
 Upon instance recovery, data loss might occur if uncommitted transactions were not written to the redo logs.

db_writer:oracle create automatically

CKPT (Checkpoint Process):oracle create automatically
Role: CKPT signals DBWR to perform a checkpoint and updates control files and datafile headers with the checkpoint information.
Impact if Killed: If CKPT is killed, Oracle will attempt to restart it. If CKPT cannot be restarted, the database will continue running,
 but with the potential for outdated checkpoint information. Over time, this can lead to slower recovery in case of a crash, 
 as the system might need to redo more work.

 File Management Concepts in Data Guard
 --------------------------------------
 Oracle Managed Files (OMF) simplifies file management by letting Oracle automatically create, name, and manage files. When OMF is enabled, 
 Oracle handles file naming and location based on predefined parameters, reducing administrative tasks.

How to tack OCR backup?
Automatic OCR Backups:Oracle Clusterware automatically backs up the OCR every 4 hours
Manual OCR Backups:ocrconfig -manualbackup /path/to/backup_directory

ocrconfig -showbackup

----------------------------------------
####What will  happen if OCR will be deleted?
-Oracle Clusterware will not  able to start properly.
-Critical cluster services,CRS,voting disks,CSS will be disrupted.
-Database instances might fail to start or function properly.
-The configuration details for all nodes in the cluster will be lost.

Restoring OCR from Backup:crsctl stop crs
                          ocrconfig -restore path/to/backup
						  crsctl start crs

If backup also not available so you need to  reconfigure Oracle Clusterware
-Perform a fresh installation of Oracle Grid Infrastructure.
-Reconfigure the cluster and add the nodes back into the cluster.

-----------------------------------------------
### what happen if OLR is correpeted?
-Oracle Clusterware services on the affected node may fail to start.
-The node might fail to join the cluster.
-CRS,CSS Not properly function 
 Restore OLR from Backup:crsctl stop crs
                         ocrconfig -local -restore /path/to/olr_backup
						 crsctl start crs
 Backup is not available:
 Deconfigure and Reconfigure the Local Oracle Clusterware:cd $ORACLE_HOME/crs/install
                                                          ./rootcrs.pl -deconfig -force
														  ./rootcrs.pl -config
>root.sh script again can help regenerate the OLR with the necessary information.
cd $ORACLE_HOME
./root.sh
./rootcrs.pl -config -init
crsctl start crs
---------------------------------------------------
what is Voting DISK
-In an Oracle RAC environment, the Voting Disk is a special file on check which servers are active and healthy.
-It keeps track of which servers (nodes) are part of the cluster.
-It helps monitor the health of each node by recording a "heartbeat" from each node regularly.
-if voting disk is unavailable the cluster might stop working to prevent data issues.
-----------------------------
what is cluster?
cluster is a group of interconnected computers


whate is clousterware?
Clusterware is specialized software that provides the infrastructure to manage clusters. 


----------------------------
What is Split-Brain Syndrome?
- when the network connecting the nodes in a cluster fails,causing the nodes to be unable to communicate with each other.
-Communication Failure: The most common cause is a failure in the network that connects the nodes, such as a network switch failure, cabling issues, or configuration errors.
- Node Isolation:Nodes may become isolated due to hardware failures or software bugs, causing them to lose communication with the rest of the cluster.
-Data Corruption:the resulting data may become corrupted or inconsistent.
-System Instability:Split-brain scenarios can lead to unstable system behavior, crashes, and loss of service availability.

-no your instance only in mount mode other instance accese the data
--------------------------------------------

what is TABLE_EXISTS_ACTION ?
-The TABLE_EXISTS_ACTION parameter in Oracle Data Pump is used to control the behavior of the import process when it encounters a table that already exists in the target database
SKIP:The existing table is not modified, and Data Pump skips the import of that table. This is the default behavior.
TRUNCATE:Data Pump truncates the existing table (removes all rows) and then imports the rows from the source into the table.
REPLACE:Data Pump drops the existing table and recreates it, then imports the rows from the source. This option will also recreate any indexes, constraints, and other table attributes.
APPEND:Data Pump appends the rows from the source to the existing table. The table structure must be compatible for the append operation to succeed.

ASM DISKS
--------
NORMAL:	    The disk is functioning properly and is available for use.
ONLINE:	    The disk is online and available to the ASM instance.
UNKNOWN:	ASM is unable to determine the status of the disk. This could be due to a failure to communicate with the disk or an issue with the ASM metadata.
FORMER:	    The disk was previously part of an ASM disk group but is no longer part of the group. This may occur after a disk has been removed or dropped.
MEMBER:	    The disk is currently a member of an ASM disk group and is part of the disk group configuration.
Offline:    The disk is offline and not available for normal I/O operations. It could be intentionally taken offline or due to a failure.
MISSING:	The disk is no longer available or cannot be located. It may have been removed or failed.
INVALID:	The disk is invalid and cannot be used for ASM operations. It may have failed or is in a state that makes it unusable.
CANDIATE: It is avalible in server but not added in disk group

OCR (Oracle Cluster Registry): Manages cluster configuration information, shared among all nodes.
 -->It contains information about cluster nodes, cluster services, and the configuration of various cluster resources.
 -->Backup and Restore: Regular backups of OCR are crucial for disaster recovery and restoration purposes. 
 -->Storage: Typically stored on shared storage accessible by all nodes in the cluster, such as a shared disk or in a filesystem.
 -->every 4hr auto backup
 
OLR (Oracle Local Registry): Stores node-specific configuration information, local to each node.
-->Fallback: In scenarios where network connectivity to the shared OCR or Voting Disk is lost,
 OLR helps in maintaining cluster operations locally until connectivity is restored.

Voting Disk: Manages node membership and ensures cluster integrity.
--> It prevents split-brain scenarios where two clusters believe they are the primary.
-->Node Voting: Ensures that all nodes agree on the state of the cluster and manage failover processes effectively.

how to tack cumilateve back tusday to firday
ChatGPT
To schedule cumulative backups from Tuesday to Friday using Oracle RMAN, you can set up a script or schedule RMAN commands to run on those specific days. Below is a basic approach using a shell script combined with a cron job for automation.

Step 1: Create the RMAN Script
Create an RMAN script that performs the cumulative backup.

bash
Copy code
#!/bin/bash
rman target / <<EOF
BACKUP INCREMENTAL LEVEL 1 CUMULATIVE DATABASE;
EOF
Save this script as rman_cumulative_backup.sh (or any name you prefer).
--------------------------------

In Oracle RMAN (Recovery Manager), you can perform incremental backups, which include Level 1 (L1) backups and cumulative backups. Here's how you can use RMAN commands for each type:

1. Level 1 Incremental Backup
A Level 1 incremental backup captures all the changes made to the database since the last Level 0 or Level 1 incremental backup.
RMAN> BACKUP INCREMENTAL LEVEL 1 DATABASE;

2. Cumulative Incremental Backup
A cumulative incremental backup at Level 1 captures all the changes made to the database since the last Level 0 backup, regardless of any intervening Level 1 backups.
RMAN> BACKUP INCREMENTAL LEVEL 1 CUMULATIVE DATABASE;

Usage Example:
Level 0 Backup: You typically take a Level 0 backup initially, which serves as a base for subsequent incremental backups.
RMAN> BACKUP INCREMENTAL LEVEL 0 DATABASE;
Regular Incremental Backup: Schedule a regular Level 1 backup to capture changes since the last backup.
RMAN> BACKUP INCREMENTAL LEVEL 1 DATABASE;
Cumulative Backup: Schedule a cumulative backup periodically, depending on your backup strategy, to capture all changes since the last Level 0 backup.

sql
Copy code
RMAN> BACKUP INCREMENTAL LEVEL 1 CUMULATIVE DATABASE;
These commands can be included in a script or scheduled as part of your backup strategy

=======================================================================================

During a switchover process in Oracle Data Guard, if it gets stuck, follow these steps:

1. Check the Logs: Start by examining alert logs and Data Guard broker logs on both the primary and standby databases. Look for any specific errors or warnings indicating why the switchover is stuck.

2. Verify Network Connectivity: Ensure that the network connection between the primary and standby databases is stable. Network issues can prevent the switchover from completing.

3. Check the Status of the Databases: Verify the role transition status using the Data Guard broker command SHOW CONFIGURATION;. This will give you the current state of the primary and standby databases.

4. Manual Intervention: If the Data Guard broker is unable to complete the switchover, manually perform the steps:
  - Convert the primary database to the standby role using ALTER DATABASE COMMIT TO SWITCHOVER TO STANDBY;.
  - Activate the standby database as the primary using ALTER DATABASE COMMIT TO SWITCHOVER TO PRIMARY;.

5. Re-sync if Necessary: If any archives are missing, transfer them manually and apply them to bring both databases in sync before attempting the switchover again.
