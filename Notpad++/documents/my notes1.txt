SQL qurey running slower?
--------------------------
1.whate is data ther are process (like yesterday 1000 data today 100000 data)
2.they have done any deployement or not (change code or modify)
3.ganereate AWR report(yeastday this time and today this time) compare both AWR reports helth same or not(cpu,load,session,..etc)
4.ganerate the explain plan (list of the table in the sql,check indexes or invaled)
5.gather stacks
6. we have to do fragmentaion also
7.we need to check plan (some times optimager will pick bad plan duto multiple resons(we need plush the plan kill the sessions restart the session)
8.the particular sql id we can enable tace and we can genaret ticket profes and we can do detailed annalsis
9 go for sql tuning adviser well give the advise

Tracing SQL Execution
---------------------
1.End-to-End application tracing  (tracing instance&database,clite identifier,service,module,action,session)
2.sql tracing(individual sql statments)
  * parse,execute,fetch count
  * cpu and elapsed time
  * physical reads and logical reads
  * number of rows processd
  * misse on the libraray catch
  * username under which each parse occurred
  * each commit and rollback
  * wait event data for each sql and summary of each trace file


===========================================================
whate is wait events in oracle?
## A wait event occurs when a session is not actively using the CPU but is waiting for some resource to become available or for an operation to complete.   

=====================================
how to boost of the SQL query?

1. Optimize the SQL Query:
  -Use Indexes
  -Avoid Full Table Scans:
  -Rewrite Queries:
  -Use Efficient Joins:
  
2. Database Configuration and Tuning :
   -Analyze Statistics: Regularly gather statistics on tables and indexes using DBMS_STATS to help the optimizer make informed decisions.
   -Optimize Execution Plans: 
   Tune Memory Settings:Adjust memory parameters like SGA and pga
   -Configure Redo Log and Undo Tablespaces: 
   
3 Utilize Oracle Performance Tools:
  -Explain Plan:
  SQL Trace and TKPROF: Use SQL trace to capture detailed performance data and analyze it with TKPROF.
  -Automatic Workload Repository (AWR):
  -Active Session History (ASH): Use ASH to monitor real-time performance and diagnose issues
  -SQL Monitoring: Use SQL Monitoring to track the execution of long-running queries and view detailed performance metrics.


4. Database Schema Design
  -Partitioning: Use table partitioning to improve performance by splitting large tables into smaller, more manageable pieces.
 
6. Regular Maintenance 
   Rebuild Indexes: Regularly rebuild indexes that may become fragmented over time.
Clean Up Data: Regularly purge or archive old data that is no longer needed.
Review Execution Plans: Periodically review and update execution plans as your data and query patterns evolve.
   
=================================================================================================================
 what is Statistics  Gathering 
 
 Improved Query Performance:Accurate statistics allow the Oracle optimizer to make better decisions when choosing execution plans.
                             This often results in faster query execution and more efficient use of resources.
							 
Efficient Resource Utilization:With up-to-date statistics, the optimizer can choose the most efficient execution plan, reducing CPU, memory, 
and I/O resource consumption. This helps in managing workloads more effectively.

Optimized Execution Plans:
The optimizer can choose the best access paths, join methods, and join orders when statistics are accurate, leading to optimized execution plans and 
reduced execution time.

Automatic Adjustment:
Oracleâ€™s automatic statistics gathering ensures that statistics are regularly updated, reducing the need for manual intervention and 
ensuring that the optimizer has the most recent data.

Better Handling of Data Skew:
With detailed statistics, including histograms, the optimizer can better handle columns with skewed data distributions,
 leading to more accurate cardinality estimates and better query plans.
 
Improved Load Balancing:
By providing accurate data distribution information, statistics help in balancing the load across parallel execution servers, 
improving the performance of parallel operations.

Disadvantages of Gathering Statistics
Overhead on System Resources:
Gathering statistics can consume significant system resources, including CPU, memory, and I/O, especially for large tables.
 This can impact system performance, particularly during peak times.
 
Possible Performance Degradation:
If statistics are gathered at inappropriate times (e.g., during peak business hours), it can lead to contention and degrade overall system performance.

Risk of Stale Statistics:
If statistics are not gathered frequently enough, they can become stale, leading the optimizer to make poor decisions based on outdated information. 
This can degrade query performance.

Complexity in Management:
Managing statistics can be complex, especially in environments with frequent data changes. Deciding when and how to gather statistics requires careful planning 
to avoid performance issues.

Potential for Suboptimal Plans with Inaccurate Statistics:
If statistics are not collected properly or are incomplete, the optimizer might generate suboptimal execution plans, 
leading to slower queries and inefficient resource usage.

Increased Maintenance Effort:
Regularly gathering and managing statistics requires ongoing effort, especially in large or complex environments.
 This includes setting up appropriate jobs, monitoring their impact, and tuning the process if needed.
 
Dependency on Histograms:
While histograms can improve query performance for skewed data, they also add complexity and can sometimes lead to unexpected performance 
issues if not used correctly.

=======================================================================================================================

							 
If you have over 100 databases and an agent (like Oracle Management Agent from Oracle Enterprise Manager) 
installed on each database, and you suspect that one of the agents is not working properly, you can follow 
these steps to identify and troubleshoot the problematic agent.
ANS:
Step 1: Check the Agent Status from Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM)
1	:Log in to Oracle Enterprise Manager (OEM)
2	:Go to the "Targets" menu and select "All Targets" or "Agents" to view the status of all agents.
3	:IDENTIFIED Problematic AGENT :
	 Look for any agent that shows as "Down," "Unreachable," or "Metric Collection Error."	
	 If an agent is not functioning correctly, it will typically be highlighted in red or show an error status in OEM.
4	:Click on the specific agent to see detailed information about its status, including the last time it communicated with the OEM server.
	 Check the "Status," "Last Upload," and "Heartbeat" metrics.
Step 2: Check the Agent Logs Manually on the Host
1	:Check the Agent Status:
	 ./emctl status agent
2	:Restart the Agent:
	 If you find issues, try restarting the agent
		./emctl stop agent
		./emctl start agent
Step 5: Reinstall the Agent (If Necessary):
1	:If the agent continues to fail and other troubleshooting steps do not resolve the issue, you may need to reinstall the agent
2	:Remove the Existing Agent:
		./emctl stop agent
		./emctl uninstall agent
3	:Install the Agent Again:

explain sga and pga?
mandatory background process?

why we need Multiplexing ?
Use a Surviving Control File: If you have configured multiple (multiplexed) control files, Oracle will continue to operate as long as at least one
control file is intact. If one control file is deleted, you can copy the surviving control file(s) to the location of the deleted file and restart the database.

what is redo log file?
why we need to put forceloging?
FORCE LOGGING ensures that all changes to the database are recorded in the redo logs, regardless of the logging settings of individual tablespaces 
or objects.

what is nologing?
NOLOGGING is used to reduce redo log generation for specific operations, which can improve performance for bulk data operations or index rebuilds

==================================================
Locking: Refers to the mechanism that Oracle uses to ensure data consistency and manage concurrency. 
          Locks prevent multiple sessions from conflicting when accessing or modifying the same data.

Blocking: Occurs when one session holds a lock that another session needs, causing the second session to wait. 
          Blocking can lead to performance issues and potentially deadlocks if not managed properly.

optimager:it is choose the best plan based on the statistics
        ->it is think we need scan full tablespace or index on the time statasticks can help to scan index
		>we can gather statasticks all object like (table,views..etc) DBMS_STATS
		->stats gathering meanse it dosont scan the full table it will give boost of performance

		Overview of GNSPD 
		
		######focus on rac and prefomance tuning basic stuff
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHAT IS  GNSPD?

GNS is a feature of Oracle RAC that provides dynamic network configuration for the cluster.		
It automates the management of host names and IP addresses within the cluster by dynamically allocating IP addresses as nodes are added or removed.
GNSPD (GNS Proxy Daemon):
GNSPD acts as a proxy for the GNS, managing communication between the GNS service and the DNS (Domain Name System) server.
It allows the RAC cluster to interact with an external DNS server without requiring direct modifications to the DNS server's configuration.
How GNSPD Works



GNSPD is the Grid Naming Service Proxy Daemon used in Oracle RAC to manage the interaction between the GNS service and an external DNS server.
It simplifies the management of dynamic IP addresses and hostnames in a RAC environment by handling DNS queries and ensuring they are correctly resolved.
GNSPD is essential for environments where the RAC cluster's network configuration needs to be flexible and scalable, reducing the need for manual DNS management.
