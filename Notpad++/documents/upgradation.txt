2. Install Oracle 19c Software:
     ->Download the Oracle 19c Software
	 ->Install Oracle 19c:During installation, do not create a new database; just install the software.
	 
3. Prepare the Database for Upgrade:
   ->Stop the 12c Database:SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE;
   
4. Perform the Upgrade
            ->Set the environment variables to point to the new Oracle 19c home
        Upgrade Using DBUA (Database Upgrade Assistant):from 19c home($ORACLE_HOME/bin/dbua)			
		
==>	(Upgrade Using Command-Line (Manual Method):	
    SQL> STARTUP UPGRADE;
SQL> SPOOL upgrade.log;
SQL> @?/rdbms/admin/catctl.pl -n 4 -l /tmp -d /tmp  ;
SQL> SPOOL OFF;
)


5. Post-Upgrade Tasks
   ->Recompile all invalid objects in the database:
   ->Run any additional post-upgrade fixups using the postupgrade_fixups.sql script.
