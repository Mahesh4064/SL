explain step-by-step migration NONASM to ASM
===============================================
**1. Pre-Migration Preparations:
 Backup: Ensure you have a full backup of your database and system before starting the migration. Use RMAN (Recovery Manager) for a consistent backup.
 ->Verify Backup
 
 **2. Prepare the ASM Environment
 a. Create ASM Disk Group using asmca
 Start ASM Instance: Ensure the ASM instance is up and running(startup mount;)


**3. Configure Oracle Database for ASM
a. Modify Initialization Parameters (DB_CREATE_FILE_DEST ,DB_CREATE_ONLINE_LOG_DEST_n)
b. Restart Database

**4. Migrate Datafiles and Redo Logs
a. Use RMAN for Migration
Backup Existing Files: Back up your current datafiles and redo logs.
Migrate to ASM: Use RMAN to migrate the datafiles to the ASM disk group.  

(RMAN> BACKUP DATABASE;
 RMAN> CONVERT DATAFILE 'path_to_file' FORMAT '+DG_NAME';)

b. Migrate Redo Logs

RMAN> SWITCH DATABASE TO COPY;
RMAN> BACKUP CURRENT CONTROLFILE;

**5. Verify and Adjust
Check: Verify that all datafiles, redo logs, and tablespaces are now located on ASM
SELECT FILE_NAME, TABLESPACE_NAME FROM DBA_DATA_FILES;
SELECT GROUP#, MEMBER FROM V$LOGFILE;



**6. Post-Migration Steps
Remove Old Files: you can remove the old non-ASM files to free up space.(rm -rf /path_to_old_files;)
b. Monitor and Tune
