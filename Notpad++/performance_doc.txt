1.Adaptive Query Optimization in Oracle
-------------------------------------
âœ… It enables the optimizer to adjust execution plans based on real-time runtime statistics.
âœ… Oracle may monitor runtime statistics using a Statistics Collector.
âœ… If it detects a bad plan, it switches join methods or execution paths.
âœ… This helps avoid poor performance due to incorrect estimates.
âœ… Use DBMS_XPLAN to check if an Adaptive Plan was used.

Scenario: Slow Query in an E-commerce Database
-----------------------------------------------
Imagine you are an Oracle DBA managing a database for an e-commerce platform. There is a table called ORDERS with millions of rows, and a query is running slowly when users search for shipped orders.

SELECT * FROM ORDERS WHERE STATUS = 'SHIPPED';

The Oracle Optimizer estimates that only a few rows will match 'SHIPPED' (based on outdated statistics).
So, it chooses an index scan, assuming it will be faster.

In reality, 50% of orders are 'SHIPPED', not just a few!
The index scan retrieves too many rows, making it slower than a full table scan.
The query runs for minutes instead of seconds!

How Adaptive Query Optimization Fixes It
------------------------------------------
 Step 1: Oracle Detects the Mistake

While executing, Oracle compares estimated vs. actual rows.
It notices that many more rows were retrieved than expected.

ðŸ›  Step 2: Oracle Adjusts the Execution Plan

Instead of sticking to the bad index scan, Oracle switches to a full table scan dynamically.
A full scan is faster in this case because Oracle can read large chunks of data efficiently.

âœ… Index scan is efficient when:

A small percentage of rows match the condition (e.g., 1-5%).
The query fetches only a few columns (covered by the index).

âœ… Full table scan is efficient when:

A large percentage of rows are retrieved (e.g., > 20-30%).
Oracle can take advantage of parallel execution.
Index lookups cause excessive I/O due to too many table fetches.

2.Optimizer Statistics in Oracle 
----------------------------------------------------
Optimizer Statistics are metadata about database objects (tables, indexes, partitions) that Oracleâ€™s query optimizer uses to decide the best way to execute a SQL query

 What is a Histogram?
A histogram in Oracle is a special type of optimizer statistics that helps Oracle understand data distribution in a column.


ðŸ”¹ Without Histogram (Wrong Estimation)
Suppose we run the query:


SELECT * FROM ORDERS WHERE STATUS = 'PENDING';
Oracle assumes that all values in STATUS are evenly distributed.

The table has 100,000 rows and 4 distinct STATUS values. meance unic values (distinct)
So Oracle estimates 100,000 / 4 = 25,000 rows for 'PENDING', even though only 500 rows exist




ðŸ“Œ What is Incremental Statistics?
Incremental statistics in Oracle allow efficient statistics gathering for partitioned tables by updating only the changed partitions instead of scanning the entire table.

âœ… Incremental statistics improve performance for partitioned tables.
âœ… Only changed partitions are updated, avoiding full table scans.
âœ… Enabled at the table or global level (ALTER TABLE or DBMS_STATS.SET_GLOBAL_PREFS).
âœ… Reduces query optimization delays for frequently updated partitions.
