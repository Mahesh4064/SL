Scenario1:- Export and import the whole orcl database

EXPDP backup
Step 1:- create a directory in os as well as in oracle.
Command for os- go to the folder where you want to create directory 
			$cd /u01
			$/u01 mkdir expdpfull
Step 2:- create directory in oracle
Command for oracle:- create directory expdpfull as ‘/u01/expdpfull’;

Step 3:- Login into oracle and create new table and insert data in it. 
	   This will help user to identify what tables will be imported.

Step  4:- expdp command on os :-

expdp userid=username/password directory=export dumpfile=expdp_export.dmp logfile=expdp_export.log  full=y 

Here,
Directory= expdpfull(one you created at os and oracle level)
Dumpfile_name and Logfile_name as per your choice with proper extensions(.dmp and .log)
Mention full=y for full expdp backup.   You can check for expdp parameters before passing values for “FULL” by expdp help=y.

IMPDP backup

step 1:- Type the impdp command as follows:-

 impdp userid=username/password directory=export  dumpfile=expdp_export.dmp logfile=expdp_export.log  full=y 

Here,
Directory_name= expdpfull(same directory where your expdp dumpfile is stored)
Dumpfile_name=expdp_export.dmp(same as expdp dumpfile name)
Logfile_name= as per your choice with .log extension
Mention Full=y for full impdp.

Note:- If you have created tables prior to expdp then they will be visible when impdp process is in progress.







Scenario2:-   Export the scott schema from orcl and import into ordb database. While import, exclude some objects(sequence,view,package,cluster,table). Load the objects which came from RES tablespace into USERS tablespace in target database.

EXPDP backup-
Step 1:- create a directory in os as well as in oracle.
Command for os- go to the folder where you want to create directory 
			$cd /u01
			$/u01 mkdir schemaexpdp

Command for oracle:- create directory schemaexpdp  as ‘/u01/schemexpdp’;

Step 3:- expdp command on os
Expdp userid=system/password dumpfile=schemaexpdp.dmp logfile=schemaexpdp.log directory=dump location schemas=scott
Here:-  if you want to give username and password as system/sys then
              \'sys\/sys123 as sysdba \'
             -directory= dump location is the directory you created in 
                                  Os (schemaexpdp)


IMPDP backup

Step1:- Type the impdp command as follows:-

Impdp userid= system/password dumpfile=schemaexpdp.dmp logfile=schemaimpdp.log directory=dumplocation table_exists_action=replace remap_tablespace=res:users exclude=table:”in(‘LOAD_EXT’)”

Here,                user id=\'sys\/sys123 as sysdba \'
                          directory=dump location is the directory whicc you created in
                                             os and where your expdp backup is stored.
		   Check impdp help=y for parameters like 
                                                            a)table_exists_action
                                                            b)remap_tablespace

			$cd /u01
			$/u01 mkdir tableexpdp

Step 2:- :- create directory in oracle
Command for oracle:- create directory tableexpdp  as ‘/u01/tableexpdp’;

Step 3:- expdp command on os
Expdp user id=\'sys\/sys123 as sysdba \' dumpfile=tableexpdp.dmp logfile=tableexpdp.log  directory=tableexpdp  tables=scott.part_emp
Here,          directory= tableexpdp is the directory created in os 
                    Check expdp help=y fro parameter a) tables





IMPDP backup

Impdp user id= \'sys\/sys123 as sysdba \'  dumpfile=tableexpdp.dmp logfile=tableimpdp.log  directory=tableexpdp  table_exists_action=REPLACE

Here,            dumpfile = tableexpdp.dmp is the dumpfile in which expdp backup
                                           Is stored.
                       directory=tableexpdp is the directory created in os.
                        Check impdp help = y for parameter table_exists_action

Table_exists_action = REPLACE   when existing table columns do not match the imported table columns.












Scenario 4:- Export only specific partition in emp table from scott schema at orcl and import into ordb database.

Step1:-

CREATE TABLE sales_range 
(salesman_id  NUMBER(5), 
salesman_name VARCHAR2(30), 
sales_amount  NUMBER(10), 
sales_date    DATE)
TABLESPACE "EXPORT"
PARTITION BY RANGE(sales_date) 
(
PARTITION sales_jan2000 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('02/01/2000','MM/DD/YYYY')),

PARTITION sales_apr2000 VALUES LESS THAN(TO_DATE('05/01/2000','MM/DD/YYYY'))
);

EXPDP backup
expdp directory=expdprow dumpfile=partexpdb1.dmp logfile=partexpdb1.log tables=anang.sales_range:SALES_FEB2000,anang.sales_range:SALES_JAN2000

IMPDP backup
impdp directory=expdprow dumpfile=partexpdb1.dmp logfile=partimpdb.log table_exists_action=append

Step 3:- expdp command on os
Expdp user id= \'sys\/sys123 as sysdba \'  dumpfile=schemaexp.dmp  logfile=schemaexp.log directory=schemaexpdp  include=table schemas=scott

Here,      check expdp help=y for “include”
                When we provide include=table for schemas=scott then while
                Exporting only tables of scott will be exported.

IMPDP backup

Impdp  user id= \'sys\/sys123 as sysdba \'  directory=schemaexpdp   dumpfile=schemaexp.dmp logfile=schemaimp.log  table_exists_action=REPLACE
