
Adding a node to an Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) environment

Hardware and OS setup: The new node should meet the same hardware and operating system requirements as the existing nodes.
Oracle software and patches: Ensure that the Oracle software version and patch levels match on the new node with the existing nodes.
Shared storage: The new node must have access to the shared storage used by the existing RAC nodes.
Network configuration: The new node must have access to the public and private networks used in the RAC setup.
Passwordless SSH: Set up passwordless SSH between the new node and the existing nodes for both oracle and grid users.

1. Add the Node to the Cluster

Install the required operating system packages.(oracle and oracle asm)
create groups,
create users oracle and grid
set .bash_profile (oracle and Grid)
Configure IPS in etc/hosts file
set passwordless connection
set oracleasm configuration -i
set oracleasm init 
scan oracleasm disks

run cluvfy for requirements check

2.Run addnode.sh on an existing node:
$ cd $ORACLE_HOME/grid/oui/bin
$ ./addnode.sh -silent "CLUSTER_NEW_NODES={new_node_name}" "CLUSTER_NEW_VIRTUAL_HOSTNAMES={new_vip_name}"
Replace {new_node_name} with the hostname of the new node and {new_vip_name} with its Virtual IP address (VIP).

3.Run gridSetup.sh on the new node: After successfully running addnode.sh,
$ cd $ORACLE_HOME/grid
$ ./gridSetup.sh
Choose the option "Add Node to Cluster" during installation.

Run root scripts: After the installation is done, you will be prompted to run root.sh

4. Verify the Node Addition:
$ crsctl check cluster -all

Verify the status of services: 
$ crsctl stat res -t

 Add Oracle Database Software to the New Node
